# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Event RSVP Application for Wedding Management

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This application is designed for event management companies to efficiently manage weddings. It provides a comprehensive platform to handle guest lists, groupings, RSVP tracking, event schedules, logistics, and notifications, streamlining the event planning and execution process.

## 2. Goals
- Enable event managers to manage guest information and groupings with ease.
- Provide real-time RSVP tracking and statistics.
- Allow creation and sharing of detailed event schedules.
- Simplify logistics management for travel, accommodation, and transportation.
- Facilitate timely and automated notifications to guests.

## 3. User Stories
### Guest Management
- As an event manager, I want to add and edit guest details so I can keep the guest list accurate and up-to-date.
- As an event manager, I want to bulk import guests from a spreadsheet so I can quickly set up the guest list for large weddings.
- As an event manager, I want to search and filter guests by name or status so I can easily find specific guests.

- As an event manager, I want to send RSVP reminders to guests who haven’t responded so I can maximize response rates.
- As an event manager, I want to view RSVP statistics in a dashboard so I can quickly assess the overall event status.
- As a guest, I want to update my RSVP status via a secure link shared with me so I can easily confirm or decline my attendance.

### Schedule/Events
- As an event manager, I want to create and edit the wedding schedule so guests know the timings and locations of each event.
- As an event manager, I want to assign specific guests or groups to particular events (e.g., only family for a rehearsal dinner) so invitations are personalized.
- As an event manager, I want to share the schedule with guests so everyone is informed.

### Logistics
- As an event manager, I want to manage guest travel details (e.g., arrival mode, pickup time) so I can coordinate transportation.
- As an event manager, I want to track stay arrangements for guests so I can ensure everyone has accommodation.
- As an event manager, I want to assign pick & drop logistics to guests or groups so transportation is streamlined.

### Notifications
- As an event manager, I want to send notifications to guests about important updates or changes so everyone is informed in real time.
- As an event manager, I want to automate reminders for RSVP, travel, or schedule changes so I save time on manual communication.
- As an event manager, I want to run a chatbot for guest queries so guests can get quick answers without direct intervention.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Vendor management (catering, photography, etc.)
- Multi-language support (not required for now).
- Native mobile app (responsive web app only).

## 6. Design Considerations
- The application should use a clean, modern, and responsive UI similar to the provided mockup.
- UI should be accessible and easy to use for event managers and guests.
- Branding should be customizable for different event management companies.
- All features must be accessible and usable on both desktop and mobile browsers (responsive design).

## 7. Technical Considerations
- Should support integration with email, SMS, and WhatsApp gateways for notifications.
- Should be built as a web application (frontend in React, backend in Flask as per user rules).
- Must use APIs for frontend-backend interaction.
- Should support secure user authentication and role-based access control.
- Should be scalable to handle events of varying sizes.
- Secure RSVP update links for guests (tokenized URLs).

## 8. Success Metrics
- 95%+ of guests have RSVP status updated before the event.
- Event managers can set up an event and guest list in under 30 minutes.
- Notifications are delivered to 99% of guests without errors.
- Positive feedback from event managers and guests on ease of use.
- Dashboards and reporting meet event managers' needs for tracking and exporting data.

## 9. Open Questions
- What level of granularity is needed for RSVP status (e.g., plus-ones, dietary preferences)?
- Should there be support for custom fields in guest or logistics data?
- Are there any specific data retention or privacy requirements?
